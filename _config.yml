#          I started this project as a way if learning <mark>React</mark> and it has since grown into a fully fledged app. I have learned many skills through this and been I'm very proud of having this in my portfolio. If you don't have a project as awesome as this I would advise you make one.

           1) Human immune cell data for 19 cytokines against 4 immune stimulants (Synthetic HIV TLR agonists (CLO97), HIV TLR agonist (Gag 1166), non-replicating lab strain HIV (AT-2), wildtype HIV virus ( NL-43)) to see if there is a significant difference. Used a heatmap to indicate which specific stimulants are significant <br />            
           2) Found out how neurons in the motor cortex relate to the direction of movement when humans or monkeys reach different goals arranged around a circle. After generating simulated firing rates of 100 of these neurons using the data, I determined how many neurons have significantly different firing rates between the first and second half, and the number of neurons with firing rates with significant gradients over time. .

           Investigated the effects of difficulty on post-stroke patients' ability to perform elbow extension/flexions. Based on our findings, we determined that adding difficulty factors to the rehabilitation treatment - namely wider range of motion and an auditory cue - resulted in subjects performing less successful extension/flexions overall.
